# HL03.04 - Imperative Emphasis
## Description
A technique to influence an LLM's behavior by explicitly emphasizing or reinforcing the instructions through authoritative language, urgency, politeness, or similar emphasizing appeals. This technique capitalizes on linguistic cues that the model associates with priority, compliance, or necessity, potentially bypassing, distracting, or weakening built-in restrictions or guardrails. 

## Example Prompt
```
