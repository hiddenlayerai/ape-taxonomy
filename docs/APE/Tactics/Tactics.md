# Tactics
## Description

Tactics represent logical groupings of Techniques, united by a common approach to achieving an objective. Where Techniques capture the "what"  method is employed at a granular level, Tactics answer the broader "how" in strategic terms, providing an overarching view of adversarial behavior patterns.

## Techniques

Each of the Tactics in the list above contain one or more Techniques. Techniques group Prompts by shared methodology, the specific approach or strategy being employed. We’ve aimed to define Techniques in their most atomic form, exposing the smallest practical units of method that can be reused or recombined. As a result, a single Prompt will often employ multiple Techniques, creating a many-to-many relationship unique to the Prompt–Technique level. This enables more flexible and precise analysis of how prompts function in an adversarial context.
