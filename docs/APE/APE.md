# Adversarial Prompt Engingeering (APE) - Taxonomy

## Introducing a Taxonomy of Adversarial Prompt Engineering

Any adversary will attempt to accomplish an [[APE/Objectives/Objectives|Objectives]] against a victim by prompting the machine. The prompt can be abstracted into Techniques, these Techniques can be abstracted to [[APE/Tactics/Tactics|Tactics]]. As a Red Teamer, someone conducting or emulating an attack will know the Objective they are attempting to achieve. As a defender you will observe the impact of the attack, but will not know the Objective unless you have direct access to the adversary, however you can assess their potential Objective based on the contents of the prompt.
