# Axioms

## HLA.01 
Prompt Injection (Direct or Indirect) is the Delivery mechanism for the attack.

## HLA.02 
Content of a prompt or series of, will define "What" the attacker is doing, these map to Tactics

## HLA.03 
Content of a prompt or series of, will define "How" the attacker is exploiting the LLM, these map to Techniques

## HLA.04 
Content of a prompt or series of, will define "Why" the attacker is exploiting the LLM, these map to Objectives

## HLA.05 
A single prompt may have multiple Techniques (therefore Tactics) present

## HLA.06 
There is an overlap between Malicious and Benign prompts

## HLA.07 
Impact is observed

## HLA.08 
Intent can only be inferred, unless you are the attacker

## HLA.09 
TTPs will map to phases of the LM Cyber Killchain. Therefore the inclusion of phasal information in the taxonomy is not required

## HLA.10 
Benign prompts can be tagged by tactics and techniques

## HLA.11 
Malicious prompts may simply be instructions that use no special tactics or techniques

## HLA.12 
Techniques and Tactics can have vague boundaries
