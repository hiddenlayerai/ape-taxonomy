## Introducing a Taxonomy of Adversarial Prompt Engineering
A taxonomy is simply a way of organizing things into meaningful categories based on common characteristics. In particular, taxonomies structure concepts in a hierarchical way. In security, taxonomies let us abstract out and spot patterns, share a common language, and focus controls and attention on where they matter. The domain of adversarial prompt engineering is full of vagueness and ambiguity, so we need a structure that helps systematize and manage knowledge and distinctions.

Our taxonomy is built on four layers, the latter three of which are hierarchical in nature:
- Objectives - Why is the attacker doing this?
- Tactics - How do their prompts help achieve their objective?
- Techniques - What specific methods do their prompts use?
- Procedures/Prompts - The adversarial prompts

## Contributions
Ultimately, the effectiveness of any taxonomy, like natural languages and conventions such as traffic rules, depends on its widespread adoption and usage. To succeed, it must be a community-driven effort. Your contributions and active engagement are essential to ensure that this taxonomy serves as a valuable, up-to-date resource for the entire AI security community.
